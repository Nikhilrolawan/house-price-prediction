</pre>

# Usage
To use the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

### Prepare your data:

Ensure that your data is in a suitable format, such as a CSV file.
Ensure that your data includes relevant features such as price , house size  etc.

### Train the model:

Run the training script to train the model on your data.
Specify the appropriate parameters and configuration for the training process.

### Make predictions:

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data.
Provide the necessary input data to the prediction script.
The model will output the predicted house prices based on the given input.
Data
The project utilizes a dataset of house prices, which should be provided by the user. The dataset should include relevant features such as price , house size etc., along with the corresponding target variable, i.e., the actual house prices.

### Model Training

The project employs machine learning techniques to train a model for predicting house prices. The specific algorithm used and the training process can be customized based on the user's requirements. The training script provided in this project serves as a starting point and can be modified as needed.
